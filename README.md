# RPG-Server
## Download
Download the following:
- [Spigot/Bukkit API](https://maven.elmakers.com/repository/org/spigotmc/spigot-api/1.19.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT/) (Recommended: Use Maven, not jar but you can use a jar.)
- [UberItems & UberItems API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pn9uvVVMd0&ab_channel=ThirtyVirus) (Watch the tutorial to build this plugin.)

OR Download the plugin now:

[RPG-Server.jar](https://www.dropbox.com/s/94ceeyb74hex29k/RPG-Plugin.jar?dl=1) (But you still need the UberItems plugin.)

## Updates
- Added Bishop Armor that gives strength 2 when left-clicked.
- Nothin' else here :(
